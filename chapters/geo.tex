\item If the altitude of a right triangle is 4 and the base is 3, find the hypotenuse.
\item If the base and altitude of a right triangle are $\frac{13}{4}$, find the length of the hypotenuse.
\item If the base of a right triangle is 12, find the possible integer values of the altitude and the hypotenuse.
\item If the hypotenuse of a triangle is 85, find the base and altitude in integers.
\item Find possible values of the base, altitude and hypotenuse of a triangle.
\item A bamboo of height 32 breaks due to wind and the tip touches the ground at a distance of 16 from the base.  Find the height of the bamboo.
\item At the base of a pillar of height 9 hands is a snake hole.  A peacock sitting on top of the pillar sees a snake 27 hands from its hole and flies to catch it
	in the direction of the hypotenuse.  If the speed of the snake and the peacock are the same, find the distance from the hole at which the snake is caught.

	in the direction of the hypotenuse
	and catches the snake that was heading towards its residence.  How far was the snake from its residence when it was caught?
